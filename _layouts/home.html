<p>Hi, my name is Xingyu (Alfred) Liu, a Data Scientist at Blizzard Entertainment. My current work focus on Gaming AI development and Computer Graphics for art assests generation. I hold a Ph.D. in Materials Science & Engineerng, and an M.Sc. in Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University.</p>

<p>Starting my early career as a materials researcher, I became a research assistant at <a href="http://sklwut.whut.edu.cn/rcdw/yjtd/">State Key Laboratory of Advanced Technology for Materials Synthesis and Processing</a> at Wuhan University of Technology, where I was studying carbon-based mesoscopic perovskite solar cells advised by Dr. Zhiliang Ku, and studying Cobalt-based pseudocapacitors advised by Dr. Liqiang Mai. After I joined <a href="https://www.noamarom.com">Prof. Marom's research group</a>, I shifted my focus to searching for singlet fission materials for their application in organic photovoltaic devices. My work was conducted with both machine learning technique and high-throughput calculations for hierarchical screening of large-scale experimental databases. I designed and developed automated workflow incorporating multi-level model training and materials sampling for generalized candidate search.</p>

<p>During the summer in 2021, I was a research scientist intern in the Accelerated Materials Design & Discovery (AMDD) team at <a href="https://www.tri.global">Toyota Research Institute</a>. I worked with Dr. Santosh Suram and Dr. Muratahan Aykol on understanding the effects on active learning agents through specifying learning range on high-throughput experimentation catalysts database. </p>
