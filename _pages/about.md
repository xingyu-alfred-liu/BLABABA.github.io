My name is Xingyu (Alfred) Liu, an alumni from Carnegie Mellon University, graduated from Professor Noa Maromâ€™s research group. I spent two years as a Data Scientist at Blizzard Entertainment after graduation, focusing on Gaming AI development and accelerated art assets generation. Currently I'm a Computational Chemist developing materials for AR/VR devices.

My previous research focus on the intersection between theoretical computational materials science and materials informatics. I have employed theoretical frameworks such as density-functional theory (DFT) and many-body perturbation theory under GW approximation and Bethe-Salpeter Equation (GW/BSE), in search of high-efficiency singlet fission materials. In addition, I have developed computer programs such as Materials and Machine Learning (MatML) workflow to perform automated materials discovery with active learning.


I am interested in lots of activities and the list keeps growing. I love playing my violin and once built a symphony orchestra with my friends during my college time. After moved to Southern California, I have become attached to outdoor activities, such as climbing, surfing, and scuba diving. Now I'm located at Bellevue, WA. Let me know if you want to grab coffee together some time.
