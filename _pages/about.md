Hi, my name is Xingyu (Alfred) Liu, a Data Scientist at Blizzard Entertainment. My current work focus on Gaming AI development and Computer Graphics for art assests generation. I hold a Ph.D. in Materials Science & Engineerng, and an M.Sc. in Machine Learning at Carnegie Mellon University.

I am interested in lots of activities and the list keeps growing. I love playing my violin and once built a symphony orchestra with my friends during my undergraduate life. After moved to Southern California, I have become attached to outdoor activities, such as climbing, surfing, and scuba diving.
