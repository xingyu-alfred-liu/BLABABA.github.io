Hi, my name is Xingyu (Alfred) Liu, a Ph.D. candidate at the Materials Science Department of Carnegie Mellon University. I have achieved a Master of Science in Materials Science & Engineerng at Carnegie Mellon University, and my Bachelor of Science in Materials Scnece & Engineering from Wuhan University of Technology.

I am interested in lots of activities and the list keeps growing. I love playing my violin and once built a symphony orchestra with my friends during my undergraduate life.
