##### Computational Discovery of Intermolecular Singlet Fission Materials Using Many-Body Perturbation Theory
Intermolecular singlet fission (SF) is the conversion of a photogenerated singlet exciton into two triplet excitons residing on different molecules. SF has the potential to enhance the conversion efficiency of solar cells by harvesting two charge carriers from one high-energy photon, whose surplus energy would otherwise be lost to heat. The development of commercial SF-augmented modules is hindered by the limited selection of molecular crystals that exhibit intermolecular SF in the solid state. Computational exploration may accelerate the discovery of new SF materials. The GW approximation and Bethe–Salpeter equation (GW+BSE) within the framework of many-body perturbation theory is the current state-of-the-art method for calculating the excited-state properties of molecular crystals with periodic boundary conditions. In this Review, we discuss the usage of GW+BSE to assess candidate SF materials as well as its combination with low-cost physical or machine learned models in materials discovery workflows. We demonstrate three successful strategies for the discovery of new SF materials: (i) functionalization of known materials to tune their properties, (ii) finding potential polymorphs with improved crystal packing, and (iii) exploring new classes of materials. In addition, three new candidate SF materials are proposed here, which have not been published previously.

##### Finding predictive models for singlet fission by machine learning
Singlet fission (SF), the conversion of one singlet exciton into two triplet excitons, could significantly enhance solar cell efficiency. Molecular crystals that undergo SF are scarce. Computational exploration may accelerate the discovery of SF materials. However, many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) calculations of the excitonic properties of molecular crystals are impractical for large-scale materials screening. We use the sure-independence-screening-and-sparsifying-operator (SISSO) machine-learning algorithm to generate computationally efficient models that can predict the MBPT thermodynamic driving force for SF for a dataset of 101 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH101). SISSO generates models by iteratively combining physical primary features. The best models are selected by linear regression with cross-validation. The SISSO models successfully predict the SF driving force with errors below 0.2 eV. Based on the cost, accuracy, and classification performance of SISSO models, we propose a hierarchical materials screening workflow. Three potential SF candidates are found in the PAH101 set.

##### 3D Electron Diffraction Structure Determination of Terrylene, a Promising Candidate for Intermolecular Singlet Fission  
Herein we demonstrate the prowess of the 3D electron diffraction approach by unveiling the structure of terrylene, the third member in the series of peri-condensed naphthalene analogues, which has eluded structure determination for 65 years. The structure was determined by direct methods using electron diffraction data and corroborated by dispersion-inclusive density functional theory optimizations. Terrylene crystalizes in the monoclinic space group P21/a, arranging in a sandwich-herringbone packing motif, similar to analogous compounds. Having solved the crystal structure, we use many-body perturbation theory to evaluate the excited-state properties of terrylene in the solid-state. We find that terrylene is a promising candidate for intermolecular singlet fission, comparable to tetracene and rubrene.

##### Assessing Zethrene Derivatives as Singlet Fission Candidates Based on Multiple Descriptors  
Singlet fission (SF) is a process where one singlet exciton splits into two triplet excitons. Utilizing SF may potentially increase the efficiency of solar cells beyond the Shockley–Queisser limit. To discover new SF materials, predictive descriptors for SF performance are needed. We consider multiple descriptors to assess several zethrene derivatives as candidate materials for intermolecular SF in the solid state. The descriptors include single molecule multiradical characters, many-body perturbation theory calculations of the thermodynamic driving force for SF and the singlet exciton charge transfer character in crystals, and a kinetic model based on molecular dimers extracted from the crystal structures. The zethrenes are compared to acenes known to exhibit SF with respect to these descriptors. The results indicate that all zethrene and heptazethrene derivatives studied here may exhibit SF. In particular, 7,14-bis(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)dibenzo[de,mn]naphthacene (Z-T) emerges as a promising candidate. Its SF driving force is higher than tetracene, whose fission process is slightly endoergic, but lower than pentacene. Its singlet exciton charge transfer character is close to pentacene, and its crystal packing leads to a higher SF rate than other zethrene derivatives. Therefore, it may undergo fast SF with high energy efficiency. The approach of considering multiple descriptors may be useful for evaluating additional candidate materials for SF.

##### Pyrene-stabilized acenes as intermolecular singlet fission candidates: importance of exciton wave-function convergence  
Singlet fission (SF) is a photophysical process considered as a possible scheme to bypass the Shockley–Queisser limit by generating two triplet-state excitons from one high-energy photon. Polyacene crystals, such as tetracene and pentacene, have shown outstanding SF performance both theoretically and experimentally. However, their instability prevents them from being utilized in SF-based photovoltaic devices. In search of practical SF chromophores, we use many-body perturbation theory within the GW approximation and Bethe–Salpeter equation to study the excitonic properties of a family of pyrene-stabilized acenes. We propose a criterion to define the convergence of exciton wave-functions with respect to the fine k-point grid used in the BerkeleyGW code. An open-source Python code is presented to perform exciton wave-function convergence checks and streamline the double Bader analysis of exciton character. We find that the singlet excitons in pyrene-stabilized acenes have a higher degree of charge transfer character than in the corresponding acenes. The pyrene-fused tetracene and pentacene derivatives exhibit comparable excitation energies to their corresponding acenes, making them potential SF candidates. The pyrene-stabilized anthracene derivative is considered as a possible candidate for triplet–triplet annihilation because it yields a lower SF driving force than anthracene.

##### An energetics perspective on why there are so few triplet–triplet annihilation emitters 
The efficiency of solar cells may be increased by utilizing photons with energies below the band gap of the absorber. This may be enabled by upconversion of low energy photons into high energy photons via triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) in organic chromophores. The quantum yield of TTA is often low due to competing processes. The singlet pathway, where a high energy photon is emitted, is one of three possible outcomes of an encounter between two triplet excitons. The quintet pathway is often too high in energy to be accessible, leaving the triplet pathway as the main competing process. Using many-body perturbation theory in the GW approximation and the Bethe–Salpeter equation, we calculate the energy release in both the singlet and triplet pathways for 59 chromophores of different chemical families. We find that in most cases the triplet pathway is open and has a larger energy release than the singlet pathway. Thus, the energetics perspective explains why there are so few TTA emitters and why the quantum yield of TTA is typically low. That said, our results also indicate that the performance of emitters from known chemical families may be improved by chemical modifications, such as functionalization with side groups, and that new chemical families could be explored to discover more TTA emitters.

##### Phenylated Acene Derivatives as Candidates for Intermolecular Singlet Fission

Singlet fission (SF), a spin-conserving process where one singlet exciton is converted into two triplet excitons, may improve the efficiency of organic photovoltaics. Only a few materials have been experimentally observed to undergo intermolecular SF, most of which are acenes and their derivatives. Using many-body perturbation theory in the GW approximation and the Bethe–Salpeter equation, we systematically investigate the electronic and excitonic properties of tetracene, pentacene, and their phenylated derivatives in the gas phase and solid state. Their potential for SF is evaluated with respect to the thermodynamic driving force and the singlet exciton charge-transfer character. In both the gas phase and solid state, pentacene and its derivatives are more promising than tetracene analogues. Within a family of molecules containing the same acene backbone, increasing the number of phenyl side groups is detrimental for the SF driving force in the gas phase. However, in the solid state, the SF driving force and the exciton character are modulated by intermolecular interactions present within different packing arrangements. Molecules with a higher number of phenyl side groups often form crystals with less cofacial interactions between the acene backbones. These crystals are found to exhibit a higher SF driving force and a higher degree of singlet exciton charge-transfer character. In particular, 5,7,12,14-tetraphenylpentacene, 1,4,6,8,11,13-hexaphenylpentacene, and 1,2,3,4,6,8,9,10,11,13-decaphenylpentacene emerge as promising candidates for intermolecular SF in the solid state.

##### On the possibility of singlet fission in crystalline quaterrylene

Singlet fission (SF), the spontaneous down-conversion of a singlet exciton into two triplet excitons residing on neighboring molecules, is a promising route to improve organic photovoltaic (OPV) device efficiencies by harvesting two charge carriers from one photon. However, only a few materials have been discovered that exhibit intermolecular SF in the solid state, most of which are acene derivatives. Recently, there has been a growing interest in rylenes as potential SF materials. We use many-body perturbation theory in the GW approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation to investigate the possibility of intermolecular SF in crystalline perylene and quaterrylene. A new method is presented for determining the percent charge transfer (%CT) character of an exciton wave-function from double-Bader analysis. This enables relating exciton probability distributions to crystal packing. Based on comparison to known and predicted SF materials with respect to the energy conservation criterion (E<sub>S</sub>-2E<sub>T</sub>) and %CT, crystalline quaterrylene is a promising candidate for intermolecular SF. Furthermore, quaterrylene is attractive for OPV applications, thanks to its high stability and narrow optical gap. Perylene is not expected to exhibit SF; however, it is a promising candidate for harvesting sub-gap photons by triplet-triplet annihilation.

##### Alleviate the *J–V* hysteresis of carbon-based perovskite solar cells via introducing additional methylammonium chloride into MAPbI<sub>3</sub> precursor

The hysteretic phenomenon commonly exists in the J–V curves of perovskite solar cells with different structures, especially for carbon-based mesoscopic perovskite solar cells without hole-conductor (carbon-based PSCs). By adding moderate amounts of methylammonium chloride (MACl) into MAPbI3 perovskite precursor, we found the *J–V* hysteresis of carbon-based PSCs could be significantly alleviated and the crystallinity of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite could also be influenced. With the increasing amount of MACl, MAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite showed better and better crystallinity until the MACl came to 0.45 M. The champion device with 0.45 M of additional MACl exhibited a preferable PCE of 14.27% for reverse-scan (RS) and 14.50% for forward-scan (FS), significantly higher than that of the pristine device (8.74% for RS and 4.80% for FS). What's more, the *J–V* hysteretic index of the device gradually decreased along with the increasing amount of MACl, and kept at low value even when the crystallinity of MAPbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite became poor. Through XRD and PL analysis, we demonstrated that the recombination rate of the accumulated charges at the perovskite/TiO<sub>2</sub> interface is the main reason for photocurrent hysteresis in carbon-based PSCs. High quality of perovskite crystals is an important contributing factor for high-performance PSCs with low hysteresis, but there is no necessary correlation between low hysteresis and good crystallinity. This research presents an effective way to fabricate carbon-based PSCs with low-hysteresis, and at the same time, provides evidence for investigating the origin of *J–V* hysteresis of PSCs.

##### Interwoven Three-Dimensional Architecture of Cobalt Oxide Nanobrush-Graphene@Ni<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>2x</sub>(OH)<sub>6x</sub> for High-Performance Supercapacitors

Development of pseudocapacitor electrode materials with high comprehensive electrochemical performance, such as high capacitance, superior reversibility, excellent stability, and good rate capability at the high mass loading level, still is a tremendous challenge. To our knowledge, few works could successfully achieve the above comprehensive electrochemical performance simultaneously. Here we design and synthesize one interwoven three-dimensional (3D) architecture of cobalt oxide nanobrush-graphene@Ni<sub>x</sub>Co<sub>2x</sub>(OH)<sub>6x</sub> (CNG@NCH) electrode with high comprehensive electrochemical performance: high specific capacitance (2550 F g<sup>-1</sup> and 5.1 F cm<sup>-2</sup>), good rate capability (82.98% capacitance retention at 20 A g<sup>-1</sup> vs 1 A g<sup>-1</sup>), superior reversibility, and cycling stability (92.70% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles at 20 A g<sup>-1</sup>), which successfully overcomes the tremendous challenge for pseudocapacitor electrode materials. The asymmetric supercapacitor of CNG@NCH//reduced-graphene-oxide-film exhibits good rate capability (74.85% capacitance retention at 10 A g<sup>-1</sup> vs 0.5 A g<sup>-1</sup>) and high energy density (78.75 Wh kg<sup>-1</sup> at a power density of 473 W kg<sup>-1</sup>). The design of this interwoven 3D frame architecture can offer a new and appropriate idea for obtaining high comprehensive performance electrode materials in the energy storage field.
